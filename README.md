# gulp-es6-seed

Because I spend too much of my precious free time setting things up whenever I want to mess about on a new
ES6-based project, and other seed projects out there are too big and not quite to my particular tastes.

If you want to try it out, it's just a matter of clone, `npm install`.

**Note:** this is a very minimalistic starter project. Many "essentials" are not included (jsHint, css preprocessing),
as the intention is to provide the core ES6 workflow and allow the developer (me) to add what I need as I go.
